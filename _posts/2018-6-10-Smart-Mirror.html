<h1>How we made a smart mirror using Raspberry Pi</h1> 

<img src="/images/smirror/pic4.jpg">  <br/>


<br/>
<p>With the huge growth of IoT devices, people’s daily necessities could be variously given more amazing functions. Today, I’m gonna show you guys the process of making a smart mirror with Raspberry Pi 3.</p>
<br/>

<h2>Functions:</h2>

<p>There are two modes of this smart mirror, security mode and active mode:

In the security mode, the mirror keeps detecting the change of  the environment with based on light and motions in front of it. If something is detected, the mirror will automatically send an email to the owner.

In the active mode, the mirror could show the time, date and current room temperature. 

There is no physical button on this mirror, an user is able to switch between these two modes by voice control.
<p/>


<h2>Things we used:</h2>

1 Raspberry Pi 3, 1 Sunfounder USB microphone, 1 RobotDyn Photosensitive Light Sensor (LDR), 1 Elegoo Ultrasonic Sensor, 1 two-way mirror, 1 Dell monitor, bunch of jump wires (primarily female-male wire), wood frames.


 <h2>Process:</h2>
<p>

1. We have to measure the sizes the two-way mirror in order to cut the wood frames, here, a big shout-out to my partner’s brother, who did a really brilliant job on cutting the woods and putting them together. Our monitor’s has the pretty much the same height as the two-way mirror and horizontally smaller than it so that we have space to fit our raspberry pi and circuit.
<p/>
<!-- <img height = "200" src="/images/smirror/pic3.jpg">  <br/>

<ul border = "10px"><img height = "200" src="/images/smirror/pic3.jpg">   <img height = "200" src="/images/smirror/pic5.jpg">     <img height = "200" src="/images/smirror/pic9.jpg"> </ul>


<p>
2. Then we move onto the circuit part, based on our objectives, we put all the electronic elements together on one bread board and have them correctly interact with our Raspberry pi.
<p/>
<ul><img height = "300" src="/images/smirror/pic10.jpg"> <img height = "400" src="/images/smirror/schematic.jpg"> </ul>

<p>
3. Then, looks like we have all the hardware set up so far, the next thing we need to do is design a software system that could
	both display information and interact with sensors. Here we used python 3 since it is easy and has a lot of libraries. For the interface,
	we used python's tkinter to construct a full screen background containing those labels which load the information from the internet and sensors.

<p>
The picture above is the software structure is very clear, each source of information is an independent module which is called in the graphic function
	every specific amount of time. Besides the sensor parts, we also have the voice controling function, which keeps listening the voice from surroundings and if 
	the keywords "switch" or "security" are heard, then the mirror will switch the mode to active or security mode, therefore, we don't need any physical button to 
	do the operations. Also for the voice recognition, we used google's voice recognition API.
<p/>


<p>
Finally after everything was working, we start putting all the parts together, we stick our monitor and circuit onto the back of 
the mirror.
