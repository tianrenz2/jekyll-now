<br/>
With the huge growth of IoT devices, people’s daily necessities could be variously given more amazing functions. Today, I’m gonna show you guys the process of making a smart mirror with Raspberry Pi 3.
<br/>

Functions:<br/>
There are two modes of this smart mirror, security mode and active mode:

In the security mode, the mirror keeps detecting the change of  the environment with based on light and motions in front of it. If something is detected, the mirror will automatically send an email to the owner.

In the active mode, the mirror could show the time, date and current room temperature. 

There is no physical button on this mirror, an user is able to switch between these two modes by voice control.
