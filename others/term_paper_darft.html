<h1>AI Programmer</h1>

<p>Now software engineer is probably one of the hottest jobs over the world as technology is growing so fast. However, sometimes coding may take too time for some people who really want to turn ideas into the practice. For some parts of coding, it could be achieved by AI perfectly, this could help both professional and non-professional people to save time on software development.</p></br>
<p>Suppose I want to write a Python function that finds out a lot of characteristics in a array such as the mean, standard deviation and even plot it into a graph, then we can just write these requirements down in natural languages, then AI would do a natural language processing to understand your requirement if there is something unclear it can also ask you. When the AI gets all the information the it could generate the most optimistic code for this function considering all the corner cases such as empty array.</p>
