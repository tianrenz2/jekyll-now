<p>Now software engineer is probably one of the hottest jobs over the world as technology is growing so fast. However, sometimes coding may take too much time for some people who really want to turn ideas into the practice quickly. 
	For some parts of coding, it could be achieved by AI perfectly, this could help both professional and non-professional people to save time on software development.</p>
